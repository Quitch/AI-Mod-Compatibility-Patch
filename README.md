AI Mod Compatibility Patch
==========================

This is Sorian's official Planetary Annihilation: Titans AI, updated to work alongside all community AI mods. Refer to it as a dependency in your AI mod and you won't need to maintain your own copy of the vanilla AI. The mod also extends the unit map support to units not covered by vanilla so you don't need to roll your own, as well as Uber pre-fixed versions of all generic builders to provide compatibility with race expansions.

This mod is open to be updated by anyone in case Quitch should vanish off the face of the earth.
